# Flyy Reflections — Website Starter (No-Inventory, Booking-First)
This static site is ready to deploy. Replace the webhook URL in `assets/js/app.js` with your Zapier/Make URL.

**Flow**: Client submits booking → your automation generates design pack → proof → vendors ship supplies/decor → you host.

**Deploy**: Upload the folder to Netlify/Vercel/Cloudflare Pages. Point your domain and go.
